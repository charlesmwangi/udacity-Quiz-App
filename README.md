# udacity-Quiz-App
This Android Quiz app is my attempt at the Project given in the Android Basics: User Interface course.
So the brief for this project is:
The goal is to create an educational app that quizzes a user about a certain topic of your choice. We want you to be creative about how you accomplish this. It’s up to you what the quiz questions will be about and how you want to present them to your user. (We recommend about 5-10 quiz questions for a reasonable scope of your app).

And the specifications are:
    App contains 4 – 10 questions, including at least one check box, one radio button, and one text entry.
    Questions are in a variety of formats such as free text response, checkboxes, and radio buttons.
    App includes a button for the user to submit their answers and receive a score.
The code adheres to all of the following best practices:
        Text sizes are defined in sp
        Lengths are defined in dp
        Padding and margin is used appropriately, such that the views are not crammed up against each other.
The app includes at least four of the following Views: TextView, ImageView, Button, Checkbox, EditText, LinearLayout, RelativeLayout, ScrollView, RadioButton, RadioGroup.
Any question which uses radio buttons allows only one to be checked at once.
The app contains at least one if/else statement
    The grading button displays a toast which accurately displays the results of the quiz.
    The grading logic checks each answer correctly
    All variables, methods, and resource IDs are descriptively named such that another developer reading the code can easily understand their function.
    The code is properly formatted i.e. there are no unnecessary blank lines; there are no unused variables or methods; there is no commented out code.
    The code also has proper indentation when defining variables and methods.
